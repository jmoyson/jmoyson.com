After 3 years as a Capgemini consultant at Airbus Defense and Space, I was hired by Airbus Defence and Space as a Software Engineer to continue working on MISEO3.

MISEO3 is a product used in several Ground Segment Software for different Earth Observation Programs to manage the Programmation, Production and Delivery of earth images.

During the time I have worked on MISEO3 I had the chance to participate to some instances of this product for several International Earth Observation Programs like Mohammed VI for morocco, Falcon Eye for EAU and others.

I was responsible for several components of the system at the time I was hired, thanks to the knowledge and experience I had acquired as a consultant.

**Technology stack:**

- Java / Java EE (JBoss)
- Eclipse RCP
- JavaFX
- Postgres
- Soap
- RabbitMQ
- Maven
- Docker

My work as component responsible, consisted in making technical and architectural choices for the components I was in charge of, based on my knowledge of the component and other component responsible and developers advices, I also ensured the code quality and releases on these components.

My work as a developer was to code, test, and push the solutions :)

#### Technical Leader / Product Owner

Since 2018 I have worked on Pulsar, a simulation and testing platform based on BPMN workflows, it has been developed at Airbus Defence and Space for complex spatial systems.

I started as a developer at the beginning of 2018, and a few months after I became the technical leader on the project, I am now also the Product Owner since January 2019.

**Technology stack:**

- Java/Spring boot
- NodesJS

My Work as Technical leader is to ensure the technical choices taken are coherent with the product we are building, I also translate the user requirements into technical requirements, and design the technical solution we need to implement them.

My work as a PO is to understand client's needs, prioritize and plan them into the next releases, and ensure the quality of the artefacts we deliver (Software and Documentation).
