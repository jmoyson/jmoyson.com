My work as component responsible, consisted in making technical and architectural choices for the components I was in charge of, based on my knowledge of the component and other component responsible and developers advices, I also ensured the code quality and releases on these components.

My work as a developer was to code, test, and push the solutions :)

#### Technical Leader / Product Owner

Since 2018 I have worked on Pulsar, a simulation and testing platform based on BPMN workflows, it has been developed at Airbus Defence and Space for complex spatial systems.
